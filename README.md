# Grouptabs Hoodie Hack

[Grouptabs](http://grouptabs.xmartin.de) is a mobile web app that helps managing shared expenses in groups.

This hack is a port of Grouptabs so it runs with [Hoodie](http://hood.ie) as a [(no)backend](http://nobackend.org).

To run it check out the Hoodie docs. Also you need Bower and run `bower install`.

This is highly experimental... Note that this version doesn't support multiple users sharing a tab except you're sharing one user account which is obviously not how it should be but it works.
